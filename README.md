# VYBE WIP

This is just a snapshot of the chaotic code for this project, it's an experiment
on using [Flecs](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/)(a c/c++ ECS lib) with Clojure.

Use it on your own risk, it was only tested on OSX and it's a mess.

Make sure you have gcc installed (see the `vybe.jnr` ns) and that you run
`clj -T:build compile-app` before running the REPL. Also populate the git
submodules.

Run `start-game` on `pfeodrippe.healthcare` to see an incomplete running
example.
